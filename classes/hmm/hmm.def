METHOD:  -gmm_mix
COMMENT: Combines Gaussians to mixtures
SYNTAX:  ()
/html MAN:
  <p>This function tries to find Gaussians which can be combined to mixture Gaussians and combines them.</p>
  <h3>Selection of Gaussians</h3>
  <p>The selection of Gaussians which should be combined to mixtures is done in that way,
  that all sets of Gaussians are detected in which all Gaussians occur at similiar edges.
  Meaning that all starting and ending states of all edges where one Gaussian of the set
  occurs, are the same for every other Gaussians in the set. So all the Gaussians in
  the set can be fully replaced by a mixture for the set.</p>
  <h3>Calculation of mixture rates and new transition probabilities</h3>
  The Calculation of mixture rates is done so, that the sum of all mixture rates is one.
  The relation between the mixture rates will be the geometrical average of the
  relations between the non-zero old transition probabilities over all edges where the set
  of Gaussians occur. The new transition probabilities are choose as the sum of
  the old transition probabilities form the combined edges. So this probability
  sum does not change.</p>
  <p>For M similiar Gaussians in a new mixture and N transitions where each Gaussian
  occurs it is done in the follwing way: (w are the transition weights and m the mixture
  rates, i is the mixture component index and j the transition index, base is one
  mixture component where all transition weights are non-zero)</p>

METHOD:  -split
COMMENT: Splits Gaussians and adjusts the HMM topology.
SYNTAX:  (double nMinRc, int nMaxCnt, data idMap)
/html MAN:
  <p>Splits the Gaussians associated with the HMM transitions along their axis of greatest variance.</p>
  <h3>Remarks</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The method dissolves covariance tying.</li>
    <li>The method dissolves mixture Gaussians (<span class="warning">warning:</span> this feature was not
        tested!</span>).</li>
  </ul>
  @param nMinRc  Minimal Gaussian reference counter (= number of feature vectors used to estimate). Gaussians whose
                 reference counters are less than <code>nMinRc</code> will not be split. If <code>nMinRc</code>&le;0,
                 the method will split <em>all</em> Gaussians. A value of about 100 &middot; {@link -get_dim} should be
                 a reasonable choice for this parameter.
  @param nMaxCnt Maximal number of Gaussians to be split (may be negative or zero in oder to split all possible regarding
                 <code>nMinRc</code>), as selection criterion variance is used, or RC if you use {@link /byrc}
  @param idMap   Defines which Gaussians are candidates for spliting, if the map is NULL it all Gaussians are candidates for spliting.
  @see <a class="code" href="gmm.html">gmm</a> <a class="code" href="gmm.html#mth_-split">-split</a>
  @cgen:option /byrc Use RC instead of variance for selecting gausians to split specified by nMaxCnt

## Errors

ERROR:   CP_WARPTYPE
COMMENT: Warp type %s is not applicable to the desired analysis type.

## Fields

FIELD:   warptype
COMMENT: Type of cepstral warping.
TYPE:    255
INIT:    "none"
MAN:     Sets the type of cepstral warping, either warping in spectral domain or in cepstral domain.
         Possible values are:
            - "none"
            - "spectrum"
            - "cepstrum"
            - "time"

## Methods

METHOD:  -analyze
COMMENT: Run cepstral analysis.
SYNTAX:  (data idSignal, data idPitch, data idReal, data idImag)
MAN:
         Runs the analysis. Instance dSignal contains the signal
         to analyse in the first component. The first alpha numeric
         component (if exist) is used as label component. In case 
         of pitch synchronuous analysis dPitch contains the pitch 
         information. dPitch must have two numeric components. The
         and as many records as signal periods in dSignal. The first
         component contains the lenght of the period in samples, the 
         second contains the voiced/unvoiced information 
         (1-voiced/0-unvoiced).
         If dPitch is omitted pitch asynchronuous analysis is performed.

METHOD:  -status
COMMENT: Display status information.
SYNTAX:  ()

METHOD:  -quantize
COMMENT: Feature dependent quantization for (lossy) converting to fixpoint type of specified bit width.
SYNTAX:  "<data idFea> <int first> <int count> <int bitwidth> <CPproc this>"
CODE:
  INT16 __nErr = O_K;

  INT32 nCount;
  CData* idFea;

  __nErr = QuantizeImpl(idFea, nFirst, nCount, nQuant, idRes);
  MIC_PUT_I(BASEINST(idRes));
  return __nErr;
END_CODE

METHOD:  -dequantize
COMMENT: This is the inverse of -quantize.
SYNTAX:  "<data idFea> <int first> <int count> <int bitwidth> <CPproc this>"

## Fields

FIELD:   order
COMMENT: FFT analysis order. Adjusts analysis length to 2^order if set.
TYPE:    short
INIT:    9
CODE:
  m_nLen=(INT16)dlm_pow(2,m_nOrder);
  m_nOutDim = m_nLen/2;

## Methods

METHOD:  -analyze
COMMENT: Run FFT.
SYNTAX:  (data idSignal, data idPitch, data idReal, data idImag)
MAN:
         Runs the analysis. Instance dSignal contains the signal
         to analyse in the first component. The first alpha numeric
         component (if exist) is used as label component. In case 
         of pitch synchronuous analysis dPitch contains the pitch 
         information. dPitch must have two numeric components. The
         and as many records as signal periods in dSignal. The first
         component contains the lenght of the period in samples, the 
         second contains the voiced/unvoiced information 
         (1-voiced/0-unvoiced).
         If dPitch is omitted pitch asynchronuous analysis is performed.

#METHOD:  -synthesize
#COMMENT: Synthesis from cepstral coefficients.
#SYNTAX:  (data dCep, data dPitch, data dSig)
#MAN:
#         <-synthesize> computes synthetic speech from cepstral-coefficients
#         and pitch data.
#
#          dCep   - Cepstral Coefficients
#          dPitch - Pitch data
#          dSig   - synthesized speech samples
#

COMMENT: Warping 
SYNTAX:  (data in, data out, double lambda, int odim)
MAN:

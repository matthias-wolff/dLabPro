  <h3>Synopsis</h3>
  <p>
Describes universal error handling macros.
  </p>
  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>All these macros call the dLabPro error handling function
  <a href="#cfn_079"><code class="link">CDlpObject_Error</code></a>. This is the <em>only</em> allowed way to
  display error and warning messages.</p>

  <h4><code>IERROR(INST,ERR,A,B,C)</code></h4>
  <p>Displays and counts error or warning messages for a specified instance.
  The location of the error (in a dLabPro script or a C/C++ source file) is
  determined automatically. This is the preferred error and warning macro.</p>

  <h4><code>IERRORAT(INST,FILE,LINE,ERR,A,B,C)</code></h4>
  <p>Displays and counts error or warning messages for a specified instance.
  The location of the error (in a dLabPro script or a C/C++ source file) my be
  specified (<code>FILE</code> and <code>LINE</code>).</p>

  <h4><code>CERROR(CLASS,ERR,A,B,C)</code></h4>
  <p>Displays and counts error or warning messages for a specified class.
  The location of the error (in a dLabPro script or a C/C++ source file) is
  determined automatically. This macro must only be used of there is no
  pointer to the instance causing the error available.</p>

    <li>The macros are defined in <code>dlp_object.h</code>.</li>

  <h3>Synopsis</h3>
  <p>
Exception mimicking macros.
  </p>
  <h3>Description</h3>
  <h4><code>DLPTRHOW(A)</code></h4>
  <p>Jumps to a label defined by the macro <code>DLPCATCH(A)</code> (same
  argument <code>A</code>!). <code>A</code> is usually an error code. The
  macro displays an exception error (<code>ERR_EXCEPTION</code>) unless
  <code>A</code> is <code>NOT_EXEC</code>. The latter case is a "silent"
  exception.</p>

  <h4><code>DLPCATCH(A)</code></h4>
  <p>Defines a jump label (<code>L_##A</code>) to which program may jump
  using the <code>DLPTHROW(A)</code> macro.</p>

  <h4>Parameters</h4>
  <p><table>
    <tr>
      <td class="hidden">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
      <td class="hidden"><code><b>A</b></code></td>
      <td class="hidden">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
      <td class="hidden">Exception code, usually an error code.</td>

  <h4>Remarks</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Because of the implementation as
    <code>label</code>/<code>goto</code>, <code>DLPTHROW</code> and
    <code>DLPCATCH</code> may only be used <em>within</em> a function
    or method.</li>

 marks (C_FIELDDEL). If such field delimiter marks are found, all text outside
 these marks will be ignored by CDlpObject_FieldFromString.

  <h3>Description</h3>
 <p>Gets the current method invocation context. The method invocation context must
 be set prior to invoking primary method invocation callback (PMIC) functions,
 option changed callback (OCC) functions and field changed callback (FCC)
 functions. The invocation context allows these callback functions to access
 prefix and postfix arguments. For convenience, the function propagates the
 method invocation context to all instance fields of this instance thus
 allowing them to access the context as well.</p>

 <p>The method invocation context struct <code>SMic</code> stores a pointer to
 the calling instance along with pointers to functions which obtain arguments
 for method calls.</p>

  <h3>Description</h3>
 <p>Sets a new method invocation context. The method invocation context must
 be set prior to invoking primary method invocation callback (PMIC) functions,
 option changed callback (OCC) functions and field changed callback (FCC)
 functions. The invocation context allows these callback functions to access
 prefix and postfix arguments. For convenience, the function propagates the
 method invocation context to all instance fields of this instance thus
 allowing them to access the context as well.</p>

 <p>The method invocation context struct <code>SMic</code> stores a pointer to
 the calling instance along with pointers to functions which obtain arguments
 for method calls.</p>

  <h3>Description</h3>
 Sets the value of the field associated with lpWord to the given value.
 The value is committed in the argument list and has to be of the
 field's type. No type validation, except instance type validation, is
 performed.

 Setting a field takes place in three stages. First, the current value
 of the field is saved and the new value is copied to the field. Second,
 the field changed callback function (FCCF) is called. Third, if the
 FCCF returns O_K the saved copy of the field's value is destroyed,
 else the field is reset to the saved value and the new value is
 destroyed (NOT for instance types!).

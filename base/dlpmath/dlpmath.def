NOTE: Memory structure of matrices
COMMENT: Describes how matrices are represented in memory.
/html MAN:
  <p>Matrices are stored as arrays of <code>double</code>s. The array is
  interpreted as sequence of <i>columns</i>:</p>
  <p><code>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;A = { a11, a21, a31, ..., a12, a22, a32, ... }
  </code></p>
  <p>The respective matrix is:</p>
  <pre>
   A = { a11, a12, a13, ...
         a21, a22, a23, ...
         ...
       }</pre>
  <p>The array index of matrix element <code>A[r,c]</code> may be computed
  as</p>
  <pre>
   i = c*rowlengh + r</code>.</pre>
END_MAN

NOTE: 32/64-Bit difference in feature extraction
COMMENT: Describes where the difference in feature extraction on 32/64-Bit occurs.
/html MAN:
  <p>The function dlm_mf_convolve in dlm_melfilter produces
  different results whether it runs on 32-Bit or on
  64-Bit Processor. This is caused by the calculation
  of the following code-line:</p>
  <code>
      z += *aptr++ * (lpIn[MLP_ABS(i-j)] + lpIn[i+j]);
  </code>
  <p>Here the compiler uses a processor function which
  doesnt produce the same results on 32- and 64-Bit
  processors.</p>
  <p>If you compile and run the following short programm
  without compilier optimization on 32-Bit machine you
  get two different results, whether on 64-Bit they are
  equal. (If you use compiler optimization on 32-Bit
  both results are wrong.)</p>
